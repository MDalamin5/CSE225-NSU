Initial array: 6 5 3 4 2 1
Pass 1:
  Find the minimum element between index 0 and 5 (inclusive), swap it with the element at index 0: 1 5 3 4 2 6 (1 exchange)
Pass 2:
  Find the minimum element between index 1 and 5 (inclusive), swap it with the element at index 1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 (2 exchanges)
Pass 3:
  Find the minimum element between index 2 and 5 (inclusive), swap it with the element at index 2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 (2 exchanges)
Pass 4:
  Find the minimum element between index 3 and 5 (inclusive), swap it with the element at index 3: 1 2 3 4 5 6 (2 exchanges)
Pass 5:
  Find the minimum element between index 4 and 5 (inclusive), swap it with the element at index 4: 1 2 3 4 5 6 (2 exchanges)

The array is now sorted in ascending order.
Therefore, the number of exchange operations performed to sort the array based on Selection Sort is 2.
